# PDR---Remote-Controll-Car

No documentation was made for this project, only a Power-Point presentation in Catalan.

## About the project
This project was developed as a final project during my ESO studies. It involved creating a self-built car that could be controlled remotely via a simple mobile app, with the car's functionality programmed using Arduino.

The project was carried out by a team of four members. Two focused on building the hardware, while the other two, including myself, were responsible for the programming. Although no documentation was created for this project, the hardware is still alive! There are old process images!
